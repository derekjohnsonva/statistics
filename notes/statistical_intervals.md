a *confidence interval* (CI) is a range of plausible values for a statistic. A CI is used by selecting a confidence level, which is a measure of the degree of reliability of the interval. The higher the confidence leve., the more strongly we believe that the value of the parameter being estimated lies within the interval.

$Z = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}}$ where $\bar{X} is the sample mean$
