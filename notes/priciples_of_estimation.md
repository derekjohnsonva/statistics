# Principles of Estimation

**Estimator**: A random variable that represents a formula: describes the manner in which we put together the values in our set.

**Estimate**: A number. It is the value we obtain when we use specific numbers with an estimator

*Sample proportion* = p=X1+ X2+ ... + XNN 

*Trimmed sample mean*: Calculated by excising the largest and smallest value/values from the sample data and calculating the sample mean of the remaining data. 

*Sample median* = The middle value of the random sample
## BIAS

$BIAS[θ]=E[θ]-θ$

We refer toθ as an unbiased estimator of θ if $BIAS[θ]=0$
( equivalently,  $E[θ]=θ$ ).

Sample variance = $s^2$ = $\frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n-1}$

The denominator is (n-1) in order to make this an unbiased estimator of 

## two principles of “good estimation”
* All things being equal, we prefer an estimator with less bias to an estimator with more bias.  In particular, all things being equal we prefer to use unbiased estimators.

* All things being equal, we prefer an estimator with less variance to an estimator with more variance.

*minimum variance unbiased estimator* (MVUE): an estimator that is unbiased and has the smallest possible variance.
